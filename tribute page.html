            <ul>
              <li>Mary Seacole was born and grew up in Jamaica, but came over to England in 1854.</li>
             <br>
              <li>She asked the War Office if she could go to help wounded soldiers who were fighting in the Crimean War (1853-1856), but she wasn't allowed.</li>
              <br>
              <li>So she raised the money herself and travelled to Balaclava, Ukraine. Here, she looked after British soldiers who had been injured.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Despite all that she did, not many people knew who she was or the amazing work that she had done after she died. Most people remember Florence Nightingale, who helped many people too.</li>
              <br>
              <li>However, people have campaigned to make sure that people remember everything that Mary Seacole did.</li>
              <br>
              <li>In 2016, a statue of her was built outside St Thomas' Hospital in London.</li>
